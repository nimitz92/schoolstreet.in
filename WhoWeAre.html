									<br />
									<blockquote>&#34;The  information to be provided on the website of the school includes affiliation status, details of  	infrastructure, names and designation of teachers, class-wise section-wise enrolment of students,  	address-postal and email, telephone Nos., details of members of the School Managing Committee 	etc.  For this purpose, every school should prepare its Annual Report containing above information 	and  upload the same on its website before 15th September of every year.&#34;</blockquote>
									<!--<a class="readmore" href="">Read More</a>-->
									</p>
									<p>CBSE <u>reminded the schools</u> again with strict attitude and stating </p>
									<blockquote>&#34;All the Managers and Principals of schools affiliated to the Board are again requested to comply with  the above orders positively without fail and the defaulting schools shall  have to hold the responsibility.&#34;</blockquote>
