									Central Board of Secondary Education (C.B.S.E.) recently issued a  <u>circular</u> directing all schools to maintain their website containing comprehensive information about the school and its management.  The circular says 
									<br />
									<blockquote>&#34;The  information to be provided on the website of the school includes affiliation status, details of  	infrastructure, names and designation of teachers, class-wise section-wise enrolment of students,  	address-postal and email, telephone Nos., details of members of the School Managing Committee 	etc.  For this purpose, every school should prepare its Annual Report containing above information 	and  upload the same on its website before 15th September of every year.&#34;</blockquote>
